Cr(1) is bonded to four equivalent O(1) and two equivalent Cl(1) atoms to form a mixture of corner and edge-sharing CrCl2O4 octahedra. The corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles are 26°. There are two shorter (1.98 Å) and two longer (2.04 Å) Cr(1)-O(1) bond lengths. Both Cr(1)-Cl(1) bond lengths are 2.33 Å. O(1) is bonded to four equivalent Cr(1) atoms to form a mixture of distorted corner and edge-sharing OCr4 trigonal pyramids. Cl(1) is bonded in an L-shaped geometry to two equivalent Cr(1) atoms.",38.93449999999987
